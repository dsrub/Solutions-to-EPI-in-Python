#### Here are my solutions (mostly in Jupyter notebooks) to a good amount of [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949).  

#### This is a great book for learning algos in python.  In my opinion, the book is far superior to Cracking the Coding Interview in terms of solutions and explanations of concepts.

#### Although I can't promise my solutions are always the most efficient in terms of time and space complexity, for many of the problems I present more than one solution if I thought of something more efficient.  I have made an effort to analyze the time and space complexity for almost all of my solutions, and I have also made an effort ensure correctness by testing on many inputs.
